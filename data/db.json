      "body": "\"Huh? But it was funny! Don't get mad at me!\"\nBorn and raised under the flag of Freedom, Gigi Murin is a free-spirited Chaser and mischievous gremlin.\n While she is proficient in chasing down targets with pure intuition, she struggles with memorizing directions and making calculated decisions.\nShe states that she'd rather not spend much time thinking because it makes her head hurt.\n These quirks are also present in her everyday life, where she tends to prioritize her instinctual craving for fun and being silly over anything else.\n She is often the source of headaches for those around her, causing trouble because she â€œthought it would be funny.\"",
